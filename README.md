## About the syntax

#### Variables
> * Variables in Scala can be declared using `var` 
> * This type of variable is mutable, in other words it can be changed 
> * To provide a data type, follow up the variable name with `:data_type` (ex. `:Int`)
> * If no data type is given, `var` will automatically detect and set the data type based on the value given
> 	* When changing the value of the variable, it must satisfy the data type
```scala
var x:String = "Variable"	// Declaring variable, data type will be String
x = "Another Variable"		// Changing value to another String
x = 5				// Will not work, 5 is not a string

var y = 5			// Data type will be detected automatically, here it is Int
y = 5.5				// Will not work since 5.5 is not an Int
```

#### 

#### Objects
> _Objects can be created using the object keyword._

```scala
object Object_Name {
	// Some code here
}
```
